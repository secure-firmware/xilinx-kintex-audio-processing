### **Steps 21-22: Output Scaling, Normalization, and Saving the Final Audio in Verilog**

Steps 21 and 22 focus on scaling and normalizing the final output audio to avoid clipping and ensuring that the audio signal is within the appropriate dynamic range. Since Verilog does not natively handle audio file outputs, these steps will focus on generating a scaled and normalized output that can later be processed externally.

### **Step 21: Scaling and Normalization in Verilog**

After reconstructing the audio signal using the overlap-add method, we need to ensure that the signal is scaled appropriately to avoid clipping or distortion. The scaling will adjust the output values to fit within the 16-bit signed integer range (-32768 to 32767).

#### **High-Level Requirements**:
1. **Find the Maximum Amplitude**: We need to determine the maximum absolute value in the output signal.
2. **Scale the Output**: Normalize the signal so that the maximum amplitude corresponds to the 16-bit range.

#### **Module 9: Scaling and Normalization (Verilog)**

```verilog
module scaling_normalization (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input signed [15:0] audio_in,  // Input audio sample (16-bit signed)
    input valid_in,                // Input valid signal
    output reg signed [15:0] audio_out,  // Output audio sample (scaled)
    output reg done                // Indicates normalization is complete
);

    // Parameters for normalization
    reg signed [15:0] max_amplitude;  // Store maximum amplitude
    reg signed [31:0] scaled_sample;  // Store scaled output with extra bits for precision

    // State machine for normalization
    typedef enum reg {IDLE, FIND_MAX, SCALE_OUTPUT} state_t;
    state_t state;

    // Registers to track the number of samples
    reg [31:0] sample_count;
    reg [31:0] total_samples;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            max_amplitude <= 16'd1;  // Avoid division by zero
            sample_count <= 0;
            total_samples <= 0;
            done <= 0;
            audio_out <= 0;
        end else begin
            case (state)
                IDLE: begin
                    if (valid_in) begin
                        state <= FIND_MAX;
                        total_samples <= total_samples + 1;
                    end
                end

                // Step 1: Find the maximum amplitude in the signal
                FIND_MAX: begin
                    if (valid_in) begin
                        if (audio_in > max_amplitude) begin
                            max_amplitude <= audio_in;  // Update max value
                        end
                        if (-audio_in > max_amplitude) begin
                            max_amplitude <= -audio_in;  // Update max value for negative samples
                        end
                        sample_count <= sample_count + 1;
                        if (sample_count == total_samples) begin
                            state <= SCALE_OUTPUT;  // Move to scaling step
                            sample_count <= 0;
                        end
                    end
                end

                // Step 2: Scale each sample based on the maximum amplitude
                SCALE_OUTPUT: begin
                    if (valid_in) begin
                        scaled_sample <= (audio_in <<< 15) / max_amplitude;  // Scale the audio sample
                        audio_out <= scaled_sample[15:0];  // Assign the lower 16 bits as output
                        sample_count <= sample_count + 1;
                        if (sample_count == total_samples) begin
                            done <= 1;  // Normalization is complete
                            state <= IDLE;
                        end
                    end
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **IDLE State**: The system waits for valid input before starting the normalization process.
2. **FIND_MAX State**:
   - The maximum amplitude of the signal is determined by examining each audio sample.
   - Both positive and negative values are considered to find the absolute maximum.
3. **SCALE_OUTPUT State**:
   - Each audio sample is scaled by the maximum amplitude found in the previous step to ensure that the audio fits within the 16-bit signed range.
   - The scaling operation uses a 32-bit intermediate value (`scaled_sample`) for precision before assigning the result to the 16-bit output (`audio_out`).
4. **Completion**: Once all samples are processed, the `done` signal is asserted.

### **Step 22: Saving the Normalized Output**

In Verilog, generating a final audio output file is typically not done directly. However, we can store the final normalized audio samples in a memory array, which can later be read out for testing or passed to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for playback in hardware.

#### **Module 10: Audio Output Buffer (Verilog)**

```verilog
module audio_output_buffer (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input valid_in,
    input signed [15:0] audio_in,  // Normalized audio sample (16-bit signed)
    output reg signed [15:0] audio_out,  // Output audio to DAC or external memory
    output reg [31:0] sample_address  // Address for writing audio samples to memory
);

    // Memory buffer to store output audio samples
    reg signed [15:0] audio_memory [0:65535];  // 64k buffer for storing audio samples

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            sample_address <= 0;
        end else if (valid_in) begin
            audio_memory[sample_address] <= audio_in;  // Store audio sample in memory
            audio_out <= audio_in;  // Output the current sample
            sample_address <= sample_address + 1;  // Increment address for next sample
        end
    end

endmodule
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **Audio Buffer**: The module stores the normalized audio samples in a memory buffer (`audio_memory`) with 64k entries.
2. **Sample Addressing**: The `sample_address` increments with each valid input, ensuring that all samples are stored sequentially.
3. **Audio Output**: The `audio_out` signal provides the current audio sample, which can be sent to external memory or directly to a DAC for playback.

---

### **Summary of Steps 21-22**:
1. **Step 21**: The audio signal is scaled and normalized to fit within the 16-bit signed range, avoiding clipping and distortion.
2. **Step 22**: The normalized audio is saved into a memory buffer, which can be used for further processing or output to a DAC.
