Overview:
The goal is to implement a phase vocoder for real-time time-stretching of audio using Verilog on an FPGA. We'll implement the following components, focusing on one at a time:

1. FFT Module: Perform FFT on the input audio.
2. Magnitude and Phase Extraction: Extract magnitude and phase from the FFT.
3. Noise Reduction: Perform noise reduction by subtracting the noise spectrum.
4. Time-Stretching: Interpolate magnitude and modify phase for time-stretching.
5. Inverse FFT (IFFT): Convert modified frequency data back to the time domain.
6. Overlap-Add: Reconstruct the time-domain signal by combining frames.
