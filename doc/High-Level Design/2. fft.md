**Vivado FFT IP Core Setup**
Vivado provides an FFT IP core that handles the Fast Fourier Transform efficiently. The FFT core can operate in pipelined mode to allow continuous processing of incoming data.

Configuration of FFT IP Core in Vivado:
1. Open Vivado and create a new project targeting your FPGA board (e.g., Spartan S7-25).
 - Add the FFT IP Core to your project:
 - Go to Tools > IP Catalog.
 - Search for "FFT" in the IP catalog.
2. Add the Xilinx FFT IP to your project.
3. Configure the FFT IP:
 - Set the FFT size to 1024 points (same as in the MATLAB implementation).
 - Enable pipelined streaming mode to allow continuous data processing.
 - Set the input data width to match your audio sample format (e.g., 16 bits).
 - Use a scaling schedule if necessary to handle the output range of the FFT.
