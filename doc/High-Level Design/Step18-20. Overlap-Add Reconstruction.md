### **Steps 18-20: Overlap-Add Reconstruction in Verilog**

Steps 18 to 20 involve implementing the overlap-add method for reconstructing the audio signal after inverse FFT (IFFT) in Verilog. This method is crucial to combine the time-domain frames into a continuous audio output signal.

#### **High-Level Overview of Overlap-Add Method**:
1. **Windowed Frames**: After the IFFT operation, each frame is windowed using the Hanning window. These frames overlap by a certain amount (determined by the hop size).
2. **Overlap and Summation**: The frames are added together by overlapping according to the hop size.
3. **Reconstruction**: The final audio signal is reconstructed by summing the overlapping frames, ensuring a smooth transition between them.

### **Step 18: Implementing Overlap-Add Logic (Verilog)**

The overlap-add logic involves combining the windowed IFFT frames into a continuous output audio signal.

#### **Module 6: Overlap-Add Logic (Verilog)**

```verilog
module overlap_add (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input valid_in,
    input [15:0] ifft_sample,  // IFFT output sample (16-bit signed)
    input [9:0] frame_index,   // Index of the current frame (10 bits for addressing)
    input [9:0] sample_index,  // Index of the current sample in the frame
    input [15:0] window_value, // Hanning window value (16-bit signed, pre-computed)
    input [9:0] hop_size,      // Hop size (distance between frames)
    output reg [15:0] audio_out // Output audio sample (16-bit signed)
);

    // Define buffer size for overlap-add
    parameter buffer_size = 1024;  // Example buffer size for 1024-sample frames

    // Buffer to store the overlap-add result
    reg signed [15:0] output_buffer [0:buffer_size-1];  // 16-bit signed buffer
    reg [9:0] write_pointer;  // Pointer for writing to the output buffer

    // Logic to perform overlap-add
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            // Reset output buffer and pointers
            write_pointer <= 0;
            audio_out <= 0;
        end else if (valid_in) begin
            // Perform overlap-add operation
            output_buffer[write_pointer] <= output_buffer[write_pointer] + (ifft_sample * window_value) >>> 15;

            // Update write pointer based on hop size and sample index
            if (sample_index == buffer_size - 1) begin
                write_pointer <= write_pointer + hop_size;
            end else begin
                write_pointer <= write_pointer + 1;
            end

            // Output the current audio sample
            audio_out <= output_buffer[write_pointer];
        end
    end

endmodule
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `ifft_sample`: The current IFFT output sample (16-bit signed).
   - `window_value`: The Hanning window value applied to the IFFT sample.
   - `hop_size`: The hop size defines the overlap between frames.
   - `frame_index` and `sample_index`: Indices for accessing samples within each frame.
2. **Overlap-Add Operation**:
   - The IFFT sample is multiplied by the Hanning window value to smooth the transitions between frames.
   - The samples are then added to the `output_buffer` based on the current position (`write_pointer`) in the audio signal.
   - The buffer is updated according to the overlap (determined by the hop size), and the new output audio sample is produced.

---

### **Step 19: Applying the Hanning Window**

Before the overlap-add operation, each frame is multiplied by the Hanning window. The Hanning window smooths the edges of each frame, ensuring there are no abrupt transitions when overlapping the frames.

#### **Module 5: Hanning Window Module (Verilog)**

```verilog
module hanning_window (
    input [9:0] sample_index,  // Index of the current sample in the frame (up to 1024 samples)
    output reg [15:0] window_value  // Output window value (16-bit signed, scaled)
);

    // Hanning window look-up table (scaled by 32768 for 16-bit signed output)
    reg [15:0] hanning_table [0:1023];

    initial begin
        // Initialize Hanning window values (pre-computed)
        // For a 1024-sample frame, values are scaled to 16-bit signed format
        hanning_table[0]   = 16'd0;
        hanning_table[1]   = 16'd10;
        hanning_table[2]   = 16'd41;
        // (Continue for all 1024 samples...)
        hanning_table[1023] = 16'd0;
    end

    // Assign window value based on the current sample index
    always @(sample_index) begin
        window_value <= hanning_table[sample_index];
    end

endmodule
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **Hanning Window Look-Up Table**:
   - The Hanning window values are pre-computed and stored in a look-up table (`hanning_table`). Each value is scaled by 32768 to fit in a 16-bit signed integer.
   - When a sample index is provided, the corresponding window value is output.
2. **Window Application**:
   - The Hanning window smooths the edges of the frame to minimize discontinuities when overlapping with adjacent frames.

### **Step 20: Frame Reconstruction Timing**

To ensure that the frames are processed and reconstructed in real-time, the timing and synchronization between frames are critical.

#### **Module 8: Frame Control and Timing (Verilog)**

This module handles the timing and control for reading and writing the frames during the overlap-add process.

```verilog
module frame_control (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input valid_in,
    output reg valid_out,
    output reg [9:0] frame_index,  // Current frame index
    output reg [9:0] sample_index  // Current sample index within the frame
);

    parameter frame_size = 1024;  // Number of samples in each frame
    parameter hop_size = 256;     // Hop size for overlap-add

    // State machine for frame processing
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            frame_index <= 0;
            sample_index <= 0;
            valid_out <= 0;
        end else if (valid_in) begin
            // Increment sample index
            if (sample_index == frame_size - 1) begin
                sample_index <= 0;
                frame_index <= frame_index + 1;  // Move to next frame
            end else begin
                sample_index <= sample_index + 1;
            end

            // Set valid_out when a new frame is ready
            if (sample_index == hop_size - 1) begin
                valid_out <= 1;
            end else begin
                valid_out <= 0;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **Frame Indexing**:
   - The `frame_index` keeps track of the current frame being processed.
   - The `sample_index` increments for each sample in the frame and resets when the frame is complete.
2. **Timing Control**:
   - The module ensures that frames are processed in sync with the clock.
   - The `valid_out` signal is asserted when the next frame is ready for processing.

---

### **Summary of Steps 18-20**:
1. **Step 18**: The overlap-add logic is implemented to combine windowed IFFT frames into a continuous output signal.
2. **Step 19**: The Hanning window is applied to each frame to smooth the transitions between overlapping frames.
3. **Step 20**: Frame reconstruction timing is controlled to ensure synchronization between the processing of consecutive frames.
